Analysis of the visualizations created by using tableau for vehicle crashes in NYC:

The trends in fatalities and injury incidents over time exhibit fluctuations, notably spiking in 2016 for deaths and in 2023 for injury incidents.

A line chart illustrates the trend of injury incidents and fatalities over time, with the year 2013 emerging as the peak in both categories. 
Notably, 2023 records the lowest number of injury incidents, while 2016 stands out as the year with the fewest fatalities.

A line chart is employed to illuminate the most prevalent hours of the day for crashes, revealing the frequency of collision occurrences 
and providing insight into peak collision times.

Bar chart is used to display the total vehicle crash records from 2012 to 2023 for each city, revealing Brooklyn as the city with the highest count. 
Additionally, the stacked bar chart visually represents the number of persons injured and killed in vehicle crashes across each city.

A heatmap is generated to depict collision density across three boroughs of NYC. Two cities are excluded due to unrecognizability by Tableau.

A dashboard is created to assemble all visualizations for easy exploration and comparison.

Finally, a release is published on GitHub with a tag, making it easy for you to connect to the Tableau interface â€” a convenient step forward in accessing 
and utilizing powerful visualization tools.

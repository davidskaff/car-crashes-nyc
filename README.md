# Data Analysis - Python
For the data analysis aspect of this project, through Python, we gathered insights into road accidents in New York City. The analysis focused on three key aspects:

    Number of Injuries per Year in NYC
    Number of Fatalities per Year in NYC
    Most Common Cause of Accidents in NYC

The answers can be found in the 'Cleaned-Vehicle-Crashes-NYC' txt file. This analysis helps in understanding the trends and factors contributing to road accidents in the city over time. If someone were to leverage these insights, they could use it to empower city officials and stakeholders to make informed decisions, implement targeted interventions, and ultimately improve road safety for residents and visitors alike.

# project overview

This project delves into the trends of collisions that have occurred across the five boroughs of New York City (NYC) from 2012 to 2023. The primary objective is to 

provide comprehensive information and actionable insights aimed at enhancing strategies for controlling and mitigating the occurrence of vehicle crashes within NYC.


By analyzing the extensive dataset encompassing over a decade of collision data, the project aims to uncover underlying patterns, identify high-risk areas, and 

explore temporal and spatial trends in collision occurrences. Through the utilization of advanced data visualization techniques, the project seeks to offer 

stakeholders a detailed understanding of the dynamics of vehicle crashes, empowering them to make informed decisions towards enhancing road safety measures and 

reducing the incidence of collisions.


The insights derived from this project have the potential to guide policymakers, urban planners, law enforcement agencies, and community organizations in 

implementing targeted interventions, allocating resources effectively, and formulating evidence-based strategies to address the multifaceted challenges associated 

with road safety in NYC. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project aspires to contribute to the overarching goal of fostering safer and more sustainable 

transportation infrastructure, thereby enhancing the overall quality of life for residents and visitors alike in the vibrant metropolis of New York City.


The project harnesses the powerful visualization capabilities of Tableau as its primary tool for analyzing and interpreting data. To ensure the reliability and 

accuracy of the analysis, an updated and meticulously cleaned dataset serves as a prerequisite, providing a robust foundation for generating actionable insights 

and informing evidence-based decision-making.


The data is sourced from Kaggle, where it underwent filtering to ensure cleanliness and suitability for visualization purposes.

Analysis

The trends in fatalities and injury incidents over time exhibit fluctuations, notably spiking in 2016 for deaths and in 2023 for injury incidents. 

A line chart illustrates the trend of injury incidents and fatalities over time, with the year 2013 emerging as the peak in both categories. Notably, 2023 records the lowest number of injury incidents, while 2016 stands out as the year with the fewest fatalities.

A bar chart vividly illustrates the frequency of collisions across five cities, revealing 2015 as the year with the highest occurrence of vehicle crashes among them.

# Data Analysis - Python
For the data analysis aspect of this project, through Python, we gathered insights into road accidents in New York City. The analysis focused on three key aspects:

- **Number of Injuries per Year in NYC**
- **Number of Fatalities per Year in NYC**
- **Most Common Cause of Accidents in NYC**

We found that 
- 2013 had the highest number of accidents.
- 2013 also had the highest number of fatalities by vehicle accidents. 
- The most common cause of accidents over the years was 'Unspecified'.
  
This analysis helps in understanding the trends and factors contributing to road accidents in the city over time. If someone were to leverage these insights, they could use it to empower city officials and stakeholders to make informed decisions, implement targeted interventions, and ultimately improve road safety for residents and visitors alike.

Data Source

The analysis is based on the 'Cleaned-Vehicle-Crashes-NYC' dataset.

How to Access

The analysis results can be found in the 'Cleaned-Vehicle-Crashes-NYC' text file while the code is in the data analysis.py file.
